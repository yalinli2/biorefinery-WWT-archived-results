Biorefinery WWT Archived Results
================================

This repository contains the archived simulation results for the manuscript titled *Design of a High-Rate Wastewater Treatment Process for Energy and Water Recovery at Biorefineries* [1]_. Scripts used to generate these results can be found in the `wwt <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park/tree/master/biorefineries/wwt>`_ module of the Bioindustrial-Park repository.

This module has been added as a whole to BioSTEAM's existing wastewater treatment configurations (the "high-rate") one.
